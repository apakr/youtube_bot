You have to have all the proper python extensions in use to work with the API and downloading tools - this is what makes this work.
You need to set up a youtube API from GoogleCloud and get credentials from there - this is how you're able to actually download the videos straight from youtube rather than using some scuffed third party app.
You need to use ffmpeg and instantiate it into your path environmental variable - this allows for the highest visual and audio quality to be downloaded.
You get channel IDs from going onto the youtuber's page and clicking share channel --> copy channel ID. The channel ID is a unique identifier - it is not just the channel name.
